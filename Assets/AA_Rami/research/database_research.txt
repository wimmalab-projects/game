Oak Chips

Readily available in several types and toast levels. Easy to rack wine off of chips or beans.

If adding chips to carboy, must figure an easy way to get the chips out.

Oak Powder

Because of the surface area that comes in contact with the wine, a little bit goes a long way.

Lends itself well to oaking during fermentation.

Easy to over-oak if you're not careful.

Difficult to rack wine cleanly (without getting some oak sediment in your wine).

Oak Barrels

Traditional, time-proven method for oaking large quantities of wine.

Provides alternative transportation over Niagara Falls.

Barrels are expensive for hobbyists to own and maintain.

They must be topped off repeatedly and kept in constant use for best results.
